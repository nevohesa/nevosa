So just so I&#39;ll make sure that I&#39;m not mistaken, you&#39;re using the RFIs workflow with, without a coordinator, right? Only with one person At a One reviewer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">One reviewer, yes. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Got it. And for submittals the same. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No submittals. Different submittals are done where I, I&#39;m the manager, I dump it in and then I us e the, you can have asmany main reviewers. You can have co reviewers. And I&#39;ve taught people t hat you, if you&#39;re, if your main reviewersoutta the office, you can review on behalf of the main re viewer. And then I&#39;ve gone through not only the you have, it&#39;seasier to show you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Sure. You can do that. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Okay. Let me start my, I think I got a pretty good one. Here&#39;s Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Recording, right? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You need to share my screen. There we go. Same screen. You&#39;re on share? Yeah. Okay. We&#39;re ge tting wrapped up withthis one project. It was our first project with acc and it&#39;s in the, oh, it&#39;s in th e final stretch. That&#39;s not good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">It&#39;s my, every time that I talk to a customer, something&#39;s wrong with sister. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There we go. Works. Okay. So submittal. Yeah. I never say it&#39;s crashed until I&#39;ve done it a few ti mes.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 1 Oh.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">And that, oh no, come on, come on. I give you love. Give you love. I&#39;ll Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Ask my colleagues if there&#39;s something new. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yeah, I was gonna go check the health. Okay. We&#39;re having something coming up. Okay, let&#39;s go to this one. So, so I&#39;mthe one who&#39;s the, was it the manager? I, I set it up in the first two stages a nd then I send it out for review. And thenreview. Step one is somebody who mainly reviews it an</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">d then use review step two as the final person to review itbefore it walks out the door, making sur</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">e lingo, everything is co cohesive, but he&#39;s the final reviewer. And I use thechoose template. I ha ve that all three set up as well for each discipline. So that has expedited quite a bit of myworkflo</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">w. But yes, I do use the different reviewers and it&#39;s according to projects. And it&#39;s according to ho w the projectmanager and the project wants to do it because I would consider him a project mana ger and he wants to see it before itwalks out the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Right. Okay. Makes sense. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And if there&#39;s more than one person that has to review it, for instance, an electrical person has to look at it, a mechanicalperson has to look at it, then we can put &#39;em all into review. Step one. If t hey wanna be grouped all at the same time or, and they can go step one is the architect, step two i s the electrical step three. So it&#39;s all according to how the projectwants to review the submittals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">Okay, great. And you&#39;re using the attachments, right? For the submitting Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ah, okay. For submittals, since this was the first project that we ever used, NA C c, we develope d a workflow thatwould work for them because they were trying to move from the old way to the new way. And to disrupt them inregards to that was a little bit harder. So what I did is ones that i nvolved the people reviewing it within this office, theycould go to a place in the files and review it using Bluebe cuz they like all the markups tools and all that. And that wasthe main thing that t</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">hey were arguing about, that they wanted to use all those tools that ACC didn&#39;t have the rightmar kup tools. Even though I go, what are you using for markup tools? But that&#39;s a whole nother topi</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">c. But if it&#39;ssomebody that is outside of our organization, like we have a consultant with for civil, I will put in the notes here and I, Iuse it as notes to them so they&#39;ll pay attention. But this one&#39;s s ubmittal for reviews and files. If it needs to be, actually asa matter of fact, I got one in here. I thi nk, see I&#39;m almost near the end. So everything&#39;s, I open, open. I hate Michael.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay. So I know there&#39;s site utility as built. This is a good one for somebody who&#39;s external. So s ubmittal included forexternal review. And then what? I didn&#39;t dump it in there. I thought I dumpe</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">d. Oh, I did. It&#39;s right here. Yes. So they canopen up this and he knows, open that, that review it a nd put it back in. Okay,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Great. And in our files, we currently don&#39;t have attachments. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">So you have references and references. The, it, it&#39;s the only glitches. RFIs come up. Sorry, Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Again, my, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay, let me see. Oh look. Reference material. Okay. So I, a lot of people like to answer their qu estions. Oh. Oh, that&#39;sinteresting. They added photos as attachments. So the, this is very interesti ng. I&#39;ve never seen them do this before. SoI&#39;m, I&#39;m, I&#39;m very, that is weird. That one threw me far lip. So what they normally do is, and I&#39;m gonna go to anotherone that doesn&#39;t have photos. Cause that&#39;s that they don&#39;t normally get a photos. It&#39;s</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">A photo, right? Speaker: 0 Huh?</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It looks like they edited a stamp as a photo.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They, it looks like they took like a snippet of something and saved it as a JPEG and then pulled it in. So that was, that&#39;sthe first time I&#39;ve seen them do that. Let&#39;s go to this one. Oh, I didn&#39;t have, okay, so this one&#39;s a good one. Okay. So on. There&#39;s two different ways that people do RFIs in thi s office. Okay. A lot of times they&#39;ll put in the question C attachedand they&#39;ll put the whole RFI i n here. And that includes the question with any sketches. And they expect that the persondoing th e review will put an answer back on the attachment. Then there&#39;s, huh?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">On the same attachment. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the same attachment. Or create it with, you can save it and say at the end, when you save, wh en you add theattachment, you can change the file name while adding it and say response I like o n the other hand to put the question inhere. And then have just sketches or reference material that they need to look at from the contractor in here. And thenwhat they do is they provide me a sugg estion answer. So when they hit official submit official answer, they can type inhere and I copy a nd paste that and put it into the client software. So there&#39;s just two ways about going and answeri ng anRFI. And it depends on what the people in the office are used to. If I can get &#39;em motivated to just read the question andput in an answer, then I don&#39;t have to, and there is no attachment to, I can get &#39;em out of that. But if it&#39;s strictlyeverything that the client or the GC requires is an attach ment and they need to put the answer on the attachment, thenthey&#39;re, they&#39;re bound by that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Got it. Okay. So like the difference between having attachments in submittals and like this refere nce list in RFIs, do youhave any kind of preference to</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh the old people like, like I said, the answering on here and you mean like references versus att achments?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. Cuz in sub submittals you have like an attachment to their specific like, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Oh I&#39;ve heard so many people, they wish that RFIs had attachments. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Okay, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m looking at you this way cuz I see you on here and I talk to faces better. So if I&#39;m looking this way I apologize. Butyeah,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The direction, sorry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But then like, you know, I know what references are and in the beginning when I started this, so mebody just said thereferences are attachments. That&#39;s all they are. So when you think of it that way, I understand what these are, but peopledon&#39;t look at it that way. They look at it as reference s, like files and photos and all that that you grabbed from internallyoff the module. They don&#39;t kn ow that you can also upload files straight here and it sticks with the RFI.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Yeah.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Versus being found someplace else. They want, there&#39;s too much involved with attachments and working outside of themodule. And that&#39;s what they do is they like to work outside of the module and they find that the RFIs middle modulesare just logs. And it&#39;s hard to get people to stop think ing about that other than just a workflow in a place that this iswhere the RFIs and, and submittals live. If I showed you other projects, it&#39;s similar to this one, but they do more of theirwork in files for RFIs and submittals. And somebody like me as a PMA takes it out of there and puts it into th e modulesand makes it go through its flow. I&#39;m like, you&#39;re you&#39;re working too hard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. That that&#39;s a lot of work. Yeah. Okay. So can I share my screen? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. Speaker: 1 Okay.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">I&#39;ll stop my share. There we go. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Oh, okay. Okay. So as a reminder you can see my screen? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;">Yes. I&#39;m, I&#39;m studying it like I always RFI. Okay, got it. Waiting for submission close RFI. That&#39;s in our why it saysclose RFI on the first block.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Mm. That&#39;s a good question. Why do you think that will happen if you&#39;ll click on that, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That just makes it totally useless because you&#39;re, it&#39;s just for record. So that&#39;s the only thing I see it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We do hear of people that don&#39;t have anyone that can kind of work with them in the system and t hey just send thememails and they do want it to be recorded in one place. So kind of a shortcut I guess</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">For record. Okay. So I was right because if you just have like me and you just need to have a rec ord and occupyOccupy in the RFI area, that&#39;s perfect cause you&#39;re just putting the information in and close it and move on. So a lot oftimes they do that at the beginning of projects where they&#39;ve done a whole bunch of back and forth. But say forinstance, by the time we get it, or by the time a project started or something, they&#39;re already on RFI 10 so you have toput one through nine in the system. So that&#39;s a good way to do it real fast.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay. Yeah. Okay. So once we submitted to review last time we talked that one of the changes t hat we are adding isthat you&#39;ll be able to choose a number of reviewers and not just one. So you&#39;l l have, each of them will be well in courtfor this and they can be, they can filter it and see what&#39;s on their</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay. Are they required? Cause little dot means required for the red one. So</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The manager can kind of skip them, the manager can skip them so they don&#39;t have to put that but yeah.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0 Okay.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And when they submit a response, they can submit an answer but also add files. Locking submitt al. Yeah.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;">So you don&#39;t have to do it as an extra step to add it. Well you still, you can still nevermind. Good. Yep. Yeah.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What you mentioned something that they would want to build on the kind of files that were there before. Do you thinkit would be useful that if there are the answers to see them like it&#39;s the subm ittals.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Oh, like how it was, how it goes down like the, yeah, like the first reviewer dumps it and it&#39;s in th ere as an attachmentand then the second reviewer can come around and go, okay, I need to tweak it a little bit. So then his has a more of anupdated copy. So you can see the progression of, of the answers on this middle. Yes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Do you think it&#39;s relevant here as well? In our files? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I think about my worst person in this office and I, I would say yes because there&#39;s one person wh o like, I think I eventold you before that likes to say bad things, but we may need his stuff for rec ord if we skip something or misssomething. So yes, to see the progression, that would be good.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Got it. Okay. So after it&#39;s submitted, it goes to the manager in this workflow. Now, last time we a lso said that when it&#39;syour, when it&#39;s your project and you are doing only for the design side, then</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 3pt;text-align: left;">as the manager it&#39;s okay that you can kindof choose what the final official response would be an d close it this way. But if it&#39;s the general contractor, it shouldn&#39;t bethis way. So let&#39;s look at both options. So one of the things that we want to add is the settings that edit visual response. So I&#39;m a ctually interested to know what you think that it means if, like, if the toggle is on or off.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Well if you just wanna, well, okay I if it&#39;s on, yeah. It&#39;s allowing project managers and admins to edit official responsebefore it&#39;s official, you know, before it goes out the door for anybody else to see if you&#39;re okay with what it comes backas. And you trust your people, you turn it off.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yeah. Okay. And then what a manager can do, can, can the manager add anything in, in your opi nion, why do you thinkshould have it?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I was trying to read the second line cuz I didn&#39;t read it yet. Official response text not allowed. Ye</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">s. Okay. What was thequestion? Because I seriously did not read that second line. No, Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No, no. Sure. So what would you expect or want the manager to be able to do if it&#39;s off, if they&#39;re not allowed to havethe official response? Should they have anything that they can do as part of th eir closing their files as well?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know what, which actually I was think I, I went off on a side thought th at this is really goodcause I think you guys are helping me to avoid my send back to the manager. I&#39;m hoping, I&#39;m hoping this is what this is, but I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m kind of, I got a brain block just now.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">No, it&#39;s okay. What what do you mean by sending back to manager? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Oh, I, oh, I&#39;m gonna share my screen really quick. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Sure. I&#39;ll stop it. Okay.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Yeah, I wanna show you, cuz this thing is, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m not used to zoom. Sorry. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">No, it&#39;s okay. You&#39;re very quick to share your screen. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Where are we? Why are we not going? There we go. Okay. I thought that was funny. I thought I had one in my court. So say for an instance, Mike</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Stevenson answers. Okay. And he pushes the submit official response and it goes tomanager and it&#39;s in my court, but I don&#39;t want, I can&#39;t send it out. I told you my worst culprit, that&#39;s who this is. So thisdoes not walk out the door without my manager seeing the final response to make sure it&#39;s</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">, it&#39;s kosher. Cause it can bereally bad sometimes. So I will take it and I will return it back to in r eview, but I&#39;ll change the reviewer to John Elvin, who is the project manager.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 So Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He get that final look and I started thinking about that. I was like, is this gonna help me with any of that? Going backand putting it back into the manager&#39;s lap before it walked out the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 I,</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s where I was getting my brain blocked from. Yeah, Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I think that maybe having a couple of reviewers can solve that. I don&#39;t know if like that permissio ns will be relevant forthat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I think it will because as long as I put him and I put my project manager in the balling court, then it&#39;ll stay there at leastuntil, and he can see that other people have responded and finally make sur e that yeah,</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Yeah, yeah. Makes sense. Yeah. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So that&#39;s where I&#39;m sorry I had, I was like, let me see how this can resolve this extra task I&#39;m doin g and that&#39;s where I, I&#39;m was looking for that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Sure it does. It does sound like an extra desk. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. Okay. So going back to what you were saying. I&#39;m sorry. No, Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No, no, no problem. Okay. So let&#39;s look at how it looks like. I&#39;ll show both sides. Okay, so if it&#39;s on, oh wait here. If it&#39;son, so you as the manager can close and distribute. Now let&#39;s say that you have four answers. Now this looks a bit morelike submittal I think. So can you kind of walk me t hrough what you understand from this model?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Like response, copy response. Oh, I like that button. Okay. Because usually I&#39;m copying it like th e old way andhighlight and, and control C. So I like the, the button that made it just a tablet faste r select reviewer&#39;s response. Oh, soyou&#39;re looking at, you&#39;re selecting Linda Bell&#39;s response as the official response. Even though Ryan</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">May have ananswer, Jim Palmer may have an answer and Sheila Cole is just rejecting the whole thing. Like she doesn&#39;t want toanswer it at all and she probably doesn&#39;t have any part of this. And then it looks like the official response was movedover to the right hand side for me to see with t he two attachments. Okay, so I got a que I got a question. So what if yourLinda</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bell is your architect or your electrical engineer? Your Ryan</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young is a mechanical engineer and Jim Palmer isthe extra mechanical engineer and they all hav e different answers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Yeah.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Who&#39;s there to combine them?</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Yeah. So first of all, what do you mean by combine? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So you wanna give one answer, one cohesive answer instead of like three different answers. So t hat&#39;s why you wouldhave someone to evaluate the answer and make sure it&#39;s in one nice way of d oing it. Unless young is approving, Ryan</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Young is approving that the response is correct and that&#39;s why he just said answer. But I won&#39;t kn ow until you hit thedown arrow to see what Ryan</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Young said if it is a disagreement of the above answer. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. Okay. So you&#39;re saying maybe you want to write a response yourself and not copy? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Correct. Speaker: 1 Okay.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">That way it&#39;s more of a, a con combo of all three. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Right. So when you&#39;re, when you have to toggle on and your, the manager can edit it so there&#39;s n o problem the managercan edit, can write the response or copy it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yeah, I like that. So yeah, they have the option to be able to take a look at everybody&#39;s answer. P roject manager, combine it, put it together. Yeah.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">And basically when you click on copy, you also copied the attachments. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Does that make sense? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;">Yes. Yes. Okay. And if you don&#39;t wanna copy the attachments, do the three dots to the side of the download, is thatremoved so you&#39;re not co you can remove the ones you don&#39;t want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Yeah. Yeah. So, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">So there&#39;s only like copy one or Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yes. Yeah. Well do you think there&#39;s a reason to add just a copy for the text or from one of the Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Options to be able to select which ones you want? If you just want the verbiage or if you just nee d just one of thosedrawings, yes, you should be able to select which one&#39;s more prevalent for the pro project manager to select whichones.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;">Great. So after you decided on the response at EverFi, what do you think would be your next step here?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well what is, oh you only have two response types. Answer and reject. Okay. That&#39;s funny. You&#39; d hit next if that&#39;s whatthe Yeah. Response type. Okay. Back watchers outta comment. They have closed RFI report. You guys are doing whatsubmittals are doing on that check the box thing. An d actually the submittals one is not really good. I don&#39;t find value init because it&#39;s not, it&#39;s only do ing a report of that. That&#39;s what happened. It&#39;s like a transmittal that the action took place. It&#39;s not the actually official submittal that was submitted to the owner or GC. So it&#39;s just a report and it n ot finding any, any use as far as a report. So I don&#39;t find it as very useful in regards to this either. Sorry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No, it&#39;s okay. So what do you expect to see there? If it&#39;s interesting at all? It&#39;s also, okay, excuse me if, if it&#39;s relevant atall for you to save it into a folder.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I wouldn&#39;t do a report. I would do maybe the whole, you know, the question, the answer if I show ed you what an RFIlooked like with the GC making the question and then we adding the answer and then the attachments behind, that&#39;s allofficial. That&#39;s done. It&#39;s now one packet that goes off t</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">o the owner or client. But that&#39;s the official record RFI or officialsubmittal and that&#39;s what needs t</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">o be recorded. Not a report of what happened. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">That would be the attachment that you&#39;ll add here. The official response attachment? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No, those are just like, say for instance those are sketches or drawings or changes of the drawing s that is included. So inother words, a transmittal would include the question, the official respons e which is typed out there and then all yourattachment instead of doing the save closed RFI repor t to folders and files that I don&#39;t find useful and and to include thewhole thing as like a whole pac ket that&#39;s more useful as a record.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">Okay. Okay. So basically the last thing that you distribute to the teams is not, it&#39;s not this. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Well, okay, so what, oh, I just figured that out. So say for instance what I do distribute, because I deal with a externalsoftware for a client, I have to go and download each one of these download s and then copy the official response anddrop it into the client&#39;s software. So if it would print out or be as one cohesive thing with the response and theattachments as a full thing and say okay, do wnload this, that&#39;s my whole thing that&#39;s going off to put into the clientsoftware or the GC softwa re, that would be extremely helpful and save a lot of time.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. By the way, you can see that there is some add comment here sec tion. Where do youthink this carbon should appear? Like you don&#39;t say</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0 Activity log Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">At activity log, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I put everything. So say for instance something happens or something&#39;s wrong or I need somethi ng for record, I putthings in those comment, you know, like in the comment box I would say if I needed to put something for record sent todumped into GC software this date or just something a s a record and the activity log is a great place that people look atreally.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Okay. So after we close the R five, this is kind of the last page again, I can take a look. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So see if I had something that it didn&#39;t have to download each one of &#39;em, it came as one. That off icial spa response, thatone whole thing came as click, I needed to download that whole thing as o ne whole packet, boom. Off to the whoeverneeds to get it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yeah. So kind of this whole pack with kind of a page tell what is RFI with a question and everyt hing. Yeah. Expert ofthis RFI basically.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0 Yeah. Okay. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Makes sense. Is there any information that you would like to see on these attachments? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">I already know that. Well why there is three of the same document. A 1 0 1. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah, that&#39;s just our designer and that&#39;s, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well I like that he misspelled Ryan too, but now it looks like somebody Rayanne, Rayanne Youn</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">g. But maybe Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">That&#39;s a name. You know, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There&#39;s no, I not really. I just, it would be, but I do like the attachments are up there versus down in references. Becausereferences you really have to scroll and you have to figure out which one i s the official response versus something thatsomebody put in there for the reviewer to look at. Ye ah. So definitely a bonus on this that that&#39;s where the officialresponse is going.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: justify;">Great. And does it better, like who uploaded this attachment and when? Or is this less relevant as it&#39;s already part of theofficial response?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Well you already, okay, so what happens a lot of times in your activity log as well is it shows wh o did that, who didupload &#39;em. So LOG usually tells that, but also your final response there wher e it says L, final response submittal byLinda Bell or Ryan Young on March. I can read that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Right, right. And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s clear, but here, like the final response, these are the reviewer s that sponsors werechosen. You can say as last. Oh perfect. And this was the manager that listed here as their closing distribute.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0 Okay, perfect. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay, great. Now I just wanna take a quick look at the same thing, but if the toggle is off, so just to see, maybe it&#39;s lessrelevant for you, but maybe think about if you&#39;re submitting it to a general c ontractor who is using BUILD and Yes. What they can do.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay, so we&#39;re, okay, so this is, now, when I think of it, the contractor who&#39;s in build, who can gr ab this, well first ofall, we&#39;re submitting the answer to them. So that should be this screen anywa ys of what we&#39;re submitting to them. Correct? Or is there one more before it goes to the GC? Yea h,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, so first of all, you submit a response obviously, and this is what the manager from the GC ca n see.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Oh, okay. Okay. So what if different people have different responses? They, Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a very good question. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You still need somebody to give that really good, you need somebody to control this before the GC season. Yeah. Yeah, that&#39;s, that is definitely one of those things you need to do before you go t one person, like the project manager of anarchitect to say, okay, let me get you this all combine d and the right one. And this time you did add two answers, Ryanand, and Linda. But, and two di fferent drawings. If you trust your GC, that&#39;s, that&#39;s one thing to grab these. And if youare dealing just directly with a GC, this would be good for &#39;em to get, you know, you don&#39;t need that control factor. Then there is,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: -3pt;text-align: left;">There is some control that now it&#39;s grayed out that GC can only choose only copy responses from the reviewers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">I see what you did. Okay. Yeah, the other one was editable. This one&#39;s not editable. Yeah. Yeah. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Small difference. But, but it, it makes a big difference in how they can work. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Perfect. And that way they officially get the re the, okay, I do like that. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well then you can see that if the GC chose to take Linda Bell&#39;s answer the two attachments are h ere and they cancontrol it. In this case</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They can, oh if they, oh there&#39;s no three dots on the side to renew it or not, they&#39;re just gonna get those two drawings.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Right, because they cannot edit the response basically. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now the question is should they add more files on themselves? Does it make any sense? Or is it j ust whatever thereviewer said,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It doesn&#39;t make sense when they get a response to add, add more files. They&#39;re like a GC is not d oing, I don&#39;t see whythey would need to add any more files to it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Right.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not unless it&#39;s going back for RFI, you know, 2.0 or you know, the next version. But that would be another RFI or oropening it up and and doing maybe a revised question.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. Okay, good. Well here they can&#39;t add watchers and a comment. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah, okay, that&#39;s good. If they have additional people on their team. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes. Okay. So that&#39;s basically it. I just wanna compare a bit with a submittals model. So it looks a bit different, but</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;ll go back to the other screen. Hold on. A submitted review approved is noted. Rejected to give and Okay, officialresponse attachment copy official response. Yeah. And that&#39;s if the last one, ok ay, hold on. So if you&#39;re copying officialresponse and those are the attachments, wouldn&#39;t it auto matically put in the final response rejected if that was the lastone automatically figured.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yes. That&#39;s a good point. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">So if you&#39;re copying, it&#39;s gonna still be the same one. But if you chose Linda</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bell, which it looks like maybe Gal Carlinwas the last one to review it and didn&#39;t like what he sa w and that&#39;s what hopefully the last person to review this isselecting. I usually go with the last pe rson to review it and that&#39;s usually my project manager. And if he says no, I justdon&#39;t get it, I, it is totally rejected, then you throw it on. But yeah, it should be automatically, whatever you selecte d, whoever, cause the attachments will have a stamp on it that reflect that it&#39;s rejected. So it&#39;s alre ady embedded on thoseattachments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Got it. Okay. Yeah, makes sense. So there&#39;s that to stack. Again, uhcontract watchers the safe on e that you did not likeand that&#39;s it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">We thought it was a great option and we&#39;re like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we test it and we&#39;re li ke, well something&#39;smissing here that we really needed. Which was the official, official part of it, not just a report.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Yeah.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0 I&#39;m Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Wondering, maybe can you show me one of your close submittal for example Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There screen, trying to remember how to do this again. The</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Sharing party. Okay, Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So let&#39;s see. We&#39;re actually going through closeout right now and I love the fact that the smells ar e going over right overto the handover, if they&#39;re labeled om. So it&#39;s one of those fun things I&#39;m d oing right now. Let me get you a good onethough. No, I don&#39;t wanna give you a closeout one cau se they are a little, a little different.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Okay.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">I wanna do a standard one. Oh we&#39;ll go. Wow. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Wow. We have been going through ONMs for a moment. Let&#39;s go through high performance cod ing product data. Sowhat you need to see a closed one and what I meant by that report that we do or that is in there or Yeah, yeah. So it onlyhappens when you go to close it out so that you could do that report and click it on. So if you want, I can do one andshow you what it looks like. I&#39;ll do one right here. I&#39;m allowed to move in here. I&#39;m the master and controller of thisproject.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s great. By the way, is it okay if we&#39;ll go over a few minutes? Just a second. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s fine. Okay. Okay. So, oh, what was it? Yeah, I forgot what the review was. Exception started causeit won&#39;t lemme move unless I put that in. Okay, so they&#39;ve closed the mid dle item report. Can you</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just try something when you&#39;ll go to John Elvin if you open them on the site and click on the cop y here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And so I&#39;m just copying this whole attachment. Yes. Yeah. And, and you and I can do it that way</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">. But they thought thiswas that.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">So if you can, you click on the Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Copy. That&#39;s the confusion. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Okay.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s the confusion that people have. Unless you&#39;re telling me it&#39;s done a different way. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So what I think that you&#39;re doing is if you&#39;re closing it without clicking on it. So it now if you&#39;ll c lose it, I think that itwould save it with the attachment as well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">If you just taught me something. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Let, let&#39;s see, let&#39;s try I, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what you meant. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I&#39;m, yeah, that might be what I meant. So hold on a second. I&#39;m trying to figure out a good folder to throw it in becauseI don&#39;t want it in any specific one. Let&#39;s go ahead and put it in the execution plan for now. I&#39;ll know go in there and takeit out. Okay, so it&#39;s closed back. No, I&#39;m probably stil l waiting for it at this point. Oh that&#39;s not gonna be it. And itwould&#39;ve dumped right in here. Ther e it is.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Okay.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Did you just show me something I did not know. There&#39;s no instruction on how to do that. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yeah. Is it like it, is it more clear and what I showed you now that it&#39;s copy to official response? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Yes, yes. Hold on. If it comes up that way. Let, Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s what you meant. Let&#39;s see. Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Okay, so I took that, took that. I&#39;m just reading through it. Okay. That would be the report. I see. But as I go downthere&#39;s more of what happened and then there&#39;s the official trans submittal. Yes, that is exactly. I will teach people theright way. Actually I have Friday. Friday I&#39;m teaching. I tea ch the PMs of our group, everybody who&#39;s like methroughout my entire company. Once a month I teach &#39;em acc. So I&#39;m gonna teach &#39;em the right way how to do this. Yes,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yes. We realize that it&#39;s maybe not a very clear button that you kind of need to click that to have some kind of file andofficial response. So yeah.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Yeah. That was not clear on how to do that. So just make sure you hit copy and the button and th en you get whathappened with it. Your transmittal, well I don&#39;t know how, but this, and this is ju st regular process, but this is what weneeded to know. And actually hold on. Even says the dates returned, returned. Returned. Perfect. That is awesome. Thank you. Right.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">You just need some attachment. You can either upload one for your own when you close the sub mittal or copy one ofthe previous ones, but just add some attachment and then it would appear he re.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">Okay, perfect. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Cool. Okay, thank you. Speaker: 1</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: left;">So yeah, we&#39;re, we&#39;re really done. Is there anything else that you want to add or ask? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">No, you just made me, well my co I do it with my once a month teaching thing. I do it with some body else and she&#39;s onvacation all this week so I had to figure out what I&#39;m, I had no clue idea w hat I was even gonna teach this Friday. Sonow I got a little something but in regards to RFIs, I ca n&#39;t wait. I know that that&#39;s gonna be very useful on everythingthat you guys keep doing. So I just gotta keep my mouth zipped until it comes out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 200%;text-align: justify;">Well it, it&#39;ll be beta soon or is already Okay. Do you wanna be part of that? Speaker: 0</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I would be happy to be part of it. I&#39;m, I was the beta for the handover and I couldn&#39;t do much in r egards to the handovercuz I re, like I said, we just went into closeout and the handover is really a wesome cuz now I can go back and forth andreference it as we&#39;re doing closeout. So I&#39;m all about beta testing if you ever wanna put me on anything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Speaker: 1 Great, Speaker: 0 Thanks.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Speaker: 1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 202%;text-align: left;">Okay.
